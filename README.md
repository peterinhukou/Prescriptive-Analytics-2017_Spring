# Prescriptive-Analytics-2017_Spring
Prescriptive Analytics is a useful quantitative technique to figure out the optimal solution under the constraint of allocated resource. This is interesting to me. In this class taught by Dr. Ching-Chung Kuo, who is a PhD of Northwestern University and very professional in this field, I learned Linear Promramming, Integer LP, Sensitivity Analysis, Simplex method, Queuing theory, Time Series Forecasting, Shortest Route, Max. Flow, Decision Tree, PERT,...etc. 
I also utilized Solver in Excel to do LP, integer LP, and sensitivity analysis. 

In this repository, I put all of 12 homeworks with solutions, as well as Dr. Kuo's materials in the class. Each assignment has about 4 questions, and Dr. Kuo's material also contain many examples. The PDFs are the questions given by professor, the Word files are the answers, the Excel files are my calculations, the PPTs are just my drawings. Although the homework was a team work, I finished all of the assignments by myself before the team members met together for discussion. 

I got grade 100 in final exam and A in this class.
