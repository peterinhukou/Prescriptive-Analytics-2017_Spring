# Prescriptive-Analytics-2017_Spring
Prescriptive Analytics is like playing a mathematical trick then you find the optimal solution. This is interesting
to me. In this class taught by Dr. Ching-Chung Kuo, I learned Linear Promramming, Integer LP, Sensitivity Analysis 
and Simplex method, Queuing theory, Time Series Forecasting, Shortest Route, Max. Flow, Decision Tree, PERT,...etc. 
I also used Solver in Excel to do LP. 

In this repository, I put all of homeworks with solutions. Although the homework was a team work, I finished all 
of the assignments by myself before the team members met together for discussion. 

I got grade 100 in final exam and A in this class.
