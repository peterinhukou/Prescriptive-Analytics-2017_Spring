# Prescriptive-Analytics-2017_Spring
Prescriptive Analytics is like playing a mathematical trick then you find the optimal solution. This is interesting
to me. In this class taught by Dr. Ching-Chung Kuo, I learned Linear Promramming, Integer LP, Sensitivity Analysis 
and Simplex method, Queuing theory, Time Series Forecasting, Shortest Route, Max. Flow, Decision Tree, PERT,...etc. 
I also used Solver in Excel to do LP. 

In this repository, I put all of 12 homeworks with solutions. The PDFs are the questions, the Word files are the answers, the Excel files are my calculations, the PPTs are just my drawings. Although the homework was a team work, I finished all 
of the assignments by myself before the team members met together for discussion. 

I got grade 100 in final exam and A in this class.
